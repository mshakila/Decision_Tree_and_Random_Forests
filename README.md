# Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forests

Business problem: We have to predict the classes using Decision Tree
and Random Forest algorithms.

There are 3 datasets :
1.  iris data
2.  fraud dataset  
3.  company dataset

To improve performance:
    non-pruning and pruning (used different max_depth) of decision trees is done
    Entropy and Gini criterion have been used.
    Different n_estimators have been used (random forest)
    test accuracy and training accuracy has been found out, 
    different ratios of train/test data have been chosen, 
    different seeds (random_sate) have been used.
    Logistic regression, Naive Bayes have also been used for modelling
